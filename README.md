# neuron-mode

neuron-mode is an Emacs major mode derived from [markdown-mode](https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
to edit notes using the [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) Zettelkasten
manager.

<p align="center"><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/329911"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/329911.svg" alt="drawing" width="600"/></a></br>neuron-mode demo in <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">doom emacs</a></p>

## Installation

1. Install [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/2011501.html) and
   make sure that the `neuron` command is in your path.

2. Install neuron-mode, either via MELPA (recommended) or
   manually by cloning this repository.

In addition, doom-emacs users can use [this configuration](#appendix-doom-emacs-configuration)
to include neuron-mode into their private config.

## Features

All commands are executed in the active zettelkasten which is either detected
by traversing the directory hierarchy upwards until a `neuron.dhall` file
is met (see [neuron configuration](https://neuron.zettel.page/2011701.html)).
Otherwise, neuron-mode will take the default zettelkasten, defined by the
`neuron-default-zettelkasten-directory`. neuron-mode will then cache the zettels
and regenerate it when needed (typically when creating a new zettel). Sometimes,
when the zettelkasten is modified externally to neuron-mode, you might need to
invalidate the cache and rebuild it manually, which is done with the
`neuron-refresh` command. This will also reload the titles displayed
next to zettel links (see next paragraph).

#### Reading

neuron-mode allows you to browse your zettelkasten directly from Emacs.
Most importantly, neuron links are shown together with their titles so that
you don't need to read the zettel from the associated HTML file anymore.

#### Navigating

neuron links can also be followed using `neuron-follow-thing-at-point`.
For queries, it will prompt you to select a zettel that match the query
under the point.

Navigating "upwards" is also possible, using the `neuron-edit-uplink`
function.

#### Searching

The `neuron-edit-zettel` will prompt you with the list of zettels, where
you can search by title, by tag or by ID using ivy.

projectile can also be useful as a complement to neuron-mode since it allows
you to search the zettelkasten by content.

#### Editing

You can create new zettels from Emacs, neuron-mode will take care of creating
the file with a generated hash in the current active zettelkasten.

Zettel links can be inserted using `neuron-insert-zettel-link` which will
prompt you to select an existing zettel in the active zettelkasten. Zettels can
also be linked and created on the fly by using `neuron-insert-new-zettel`.

To avoid typos in tags which might mess up the organization of your
zettelkasten, use `neuron-add-tag`/`neuron-add-tags` which will allow you to
select from already existing tags.

#### Using rib

Rib commands can be executed from Emacs. Running `neuron-rib-generate` will
compile your zettelkasten to HTML. This can also be done automatically using
`neuron-rib-watch` which will generate every time you save a zettel.

The resulting HTML files can then be accessed either from neuron-mode with
`neuron-open-current-zettel` which will open the HTML that is associated with
the zettel being edited, or globally with `neuron-open-zettel`.

Alternatively, you can use the rib server to read your zettelkasten from your
browser. The server can be started using `neuron-rib-serve` and stopped using
`neuron-rib-kill`. Similar functions are provided to open the zettels in
the web app rather than local files (respectively
`neuron-rib-open-current-zettel` and `neuron-rib-open-zettel`).

## Configuration

### Customize settings

- `neuron-default-zettelkasten-directory` (default: `"~/zettelkasten`) \
  Defines the fallback zettelkasten when the current directory is not located in
  a zettelkasten.
- `neuron-executable` (default: `neuron`) \
  Path or wrapper around the neuron executable. \
  Example: this can be useful when using Emacs from Windows,
  while having neuron installed on WSL, in which case you can
  set `neuron-executable` to `wsl neuron`.
- `neuron-generate-on-save` (default: `nil`) \
  Generates the site when saving a note. Opens a compilation buffer
  (`neuron-rib-generate`)
- `neuron-id-format` (default: `'hash`) \
  Controls the default ID format used when creating new notes. \
  It can be set to:
  - `'hash`: generates an unique 32 bit UUID (default behavior of neuron)
  - `'date`: generates an ID based on the date of creation
  - `'prompt`: asks for the ID when creating a new zettel
- `neuron-default-tags` (default: `nil`) \
  A list of tags to add to zettels when they are created.
  This does not affect daily notes. \
  Example: `stub` (to mimic [Wikipedia's stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub))
- `neuron-daily-note-id-format` (default: `"%Y-%m-%d"`) \
  Format that controls the filenames of newly created daily notes
- `neuron-daily-note-title-format` (default: `"%x"`) \
  The format of titles for new daily notes
- `neuron-daily-note-tags` (default: `(list "journal/daily")`) \
  The default tag of daily notes.

### Other variables

- `neuron-make-title` (default: capitalizes the first word) \
  A function that is called by `neuron-create-zettel-from-selection` to
  transform the text into the actual title of the new zettel.
- `neuron-show-ids` (default: `nil`) \
  Whether to show the IDs next to zettel titles, rather than having the titles
  completely hide them. Can be toggled using `neuron-toggle-id-visibility`.

## Appendix: doom-emacs configuration

doom-emacs users can use this configuration to work with `neuron-mode`:

<https://gist.github.com/felko/cdb3fc19b3a60db27eb3c5bd319fc479>

(include those files in `.emacs.d/modules/tools/neuron`)

This creates a private module that can then be enabled by
inserting `neuron` under the `:tools` section of your `doom!`
block (inside your `init.el`).
